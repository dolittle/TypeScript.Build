This project represents a base build pipeline for TypeScript based projects.
Everything that is common among any TypeScript project, be it a node or browser (client) based, is found here.

## Using it

The idea is that this package serves as a foundation to build specific tools for building node and browser applications.

Read the documentation [here](https://dolittle.io/tooling/typescript/build)

## Dependencies

This project has all its dependencies as regular dependencies, which is why it is important to add a reference to
this package as a dev dependency. The reason for this is to be able to get all the packages down that the
build pipeline need onto your developer box.

## Tests

This package also provides every dependency you'd need to perform tests using the [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) framework
